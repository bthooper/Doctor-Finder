pecifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
I have an executable file that instantiates a CLI object that interacts with the user and calls other methods.
- [x] Pull data from an external source
I pull a list of doctors from Zocdoc.com.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
I pull additional details about a specfic doctor by calling open-uri on a specific url for that doctor.
